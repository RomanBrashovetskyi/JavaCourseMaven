**task1Array**:
Just arrays

**task2UniqueValue**:
Create method that returning unique value from int[] arr = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5} 


**task3Anagram**:
Write an application that reverses all the letter-symbols words

input text=> "abcd efgh"
result=> "dcba hgfe"

All non-letter symbols should stay on the same places!

input text=> "a1bcd efg!h"
result=> "d1cba hgf!e"

Use Latin alphabet for test only.

Hint:
1. Start with the implementation of a method that reverses only 1 word at a time.
2. (Optional) Add Main (Application) class where you can read console input or hardcode it to check yourself.
3. Add a method that splits the string into words and runs the previous method for each word
